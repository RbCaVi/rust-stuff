    // this is a common problem in most or all standard

    // the linear nature of the code also restricts the complexity of structures
    // most of the time you probably don't need weird branching and rejoining
    // of code paths, but when you do, most languages force you to use either several
    // boolean flags to track which branch to take or goto (which usually makes code harder to understand)
    // the restriction of code to one dimension forces branching structures to have at least one branch far
    // from it's root, which makes code with lots of branches difficult to read
